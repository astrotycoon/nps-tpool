README for the NPS Pthread Pool Library
=======================================
See LICENSE for information on use and rights.

Refer to the online project documentation for more information

Build
-----
To build the project:
	make all

This builds the static library 'libpool.a' against which you
can link your C project.


Testing
-------
Its advisable to run the unit tests to verify the library is
compatible with the thread library you are using. This can be
done via the command

	make tests

A period is printed to stdout for each successful unit test.
If there is a failure, that unit test prints a capital F, e.g.
	......F....F......FF...F...


Individual unit tests can be re-run using the test suite binary,
using the following command:
	./thr_pool_test <name of test>
Please include the output from the failed unit test, when
submitting a bug report.

The names of all tests in the test suite binary can be learned by
running the binary with no arguments, i.e.
	./thr_pool_test
